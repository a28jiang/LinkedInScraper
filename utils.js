        'What should we do if are independent contractors or bartenders? We all work in the event industry and everything has been shut down. Most of us live shift to shift. My entire industry family is struggling and we are terrified of how we will make it to the end of March.  We are helping each other and offering up cash jobs to each other. ANY suggestions on how to the bartenders and service industry can make ends meet and survive until we are able to make drinks and serve food again!üíôüò∞  Thank you!!\n' +

        '            Mark thank you so much for thinking of us small business Owners . I own a tuxedo and suit rental shop and I also do alterations. With all of this going on it is really going to hurt my business if all of the local school proms are cancelled because this is what financially gets me through the year. I am hoping and praying that if they don‚Äôt have them at all I am going to have to refund all of the money to the ones that already came in to reserve their tux for the prom. I am really stressing. Thank you for listening.\n' +

I have clients drop their vehicles off to me or I travel to them. Which ever I choose to do involves a lot of travel and the travel advisory restricts any non essential travel. The beginning of car season is coming within the month and clients will need their vehicles in shape for the season. Should I just hold tight until (hopefully) everything passes or should I push harder to get clients since the market will be tighter?\n' +
